## AGENT REGISTRY — AUTHORITATIVE COUNT
> Verified against code 2026-06-15. Do not re-derive; reference this.

| Layer | Count | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Generic department agents | **83** | 16 Marketing, 10 Sales, 6 Legal, 4 HR, 7 Finance, 12 Operations, 7 Paid Media, 8 Design, 5 Reputation, 8 CEO. Verified in `packages/agents/src/departments/*.ts` |
| Industry-packed agents | **63** | Across 8 packs: Law, Real Estate, Restaurants, Coaches, Trades, Salons, Agencies, Consultants. Verified in `packages/agents/src/packs/*.ts` |
| **`allAgents` total** | **146** | Flat pool, brand-laws applied. `getAgent(id)` resolves all 146. |

**Why public pages say "83":** `getDepartmentAgents()` returns generic agents only by default. Pack agents are **entitlement-gated** (W54.1) — they enter a roster only when the user owns that pack. So 83 = what every user gets out of the box; 146 = total in code. Both correct.

**Stale numbers to ignore:** The Phase 1 audit said "138 (83+55)" — the 55 was an Explore-subagent undercount; real pack count is 63. Memory's "195" = the original agency-agents source pool, consolidated down to 146 during adaptation (not a loss).

**Pricing + landing page per-dept counts:** verified accurate and matching code (2026-06-15).

## SECTION 1 — ACTIVE STATE

### Last completed work
- **Landing page full redesign** — `apps/web/app/page.tsx` rebuilt: sticky nav, hero + product mock, How It Works, all 10 departments, 4 feature highlights, pricing callout, trust section, final CTA, proper footer. Zero console errors. 476/477 tests still green.
- **W71.5** — Super-admin dogfooding pack (commit `9737e8a`)
  - `COMP_EMAILS` exported, `chris.rupert@cybridagency.com` added
  - Admin nav button in `dashboard/page.tsx` (visible when `isSuperAdminClient()` = true)
  - `useEffectivePlan()` hook + `staffd_view_as_plan` localStorage key
  - "View Dashboard As" radio card in `/dashboard/admin`
  - Shared `signOut()` helper clearing `staffd_view_as_plan`
  - Test floor: 476/477 passed (1 skipped)

### Current blockers
- **W71.fix PB reconciliation** — `rules: "failed"` on `/api/setup/workflow-tasks` (field name `user_id` vs `user` on PB `workflows` + `workflow_tasks` collections). Blocks W72.
- **NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_EMAIL** not set in Vercel — Admin nav hidden in production until this is set.

### W72 status
- **BLOCKED** on W71.fix PB reconciliation completing first

### ⚠️ DEPLOYMENT STATUS (2026-06-15)
**Everything built this session is LOCAL and uncommitted** — landing redesign, T1-1→T1-8, pbEscape
standardization, Smart Search, Google OAuth, FC-1 read integrations, integrations health-check.
None of it is live on urstaffd.com until committed + pushed (Vercel auto-deploys `main`).
To test the integrations in prod (and to demo any of this), these changes must be pushed first.

## SECTION 2 — TIER 1: CRITICAL FIXES
> Must ship before scaling user acquisition. ~20h total.

| ID | Item | Hours | Status | Depends On | Key Files |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| T1-1 | W71.fix: PB reconciliation (delete wrong collections, re-run setup route, verify T17) | 0.5h | ✅ 2026-06-15 | — | `/api/setup/workflow-tasks` |
| T1-2 | Vercel: set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_EMAIL=chris.rupert@cybridagency.com` | 0.1h | ⬜ **USER ACTION** | — | Vercel dashboard |
| T1-3 | W70.2: Orchestrator thread-continuity regression (turns 2/3 wrong dept) | 8h | ✅ 2026-06-15 | — | `CommandCenter.tsx` — `condenseForOrchestrator()` drops coordinator stubs + truncates deliverables so latest user msg drives routing. +7 tests. |
| T1-4 | Groq → Anthropic fallback on error (catch Groq fail, fall through to Haiku) | 1h | ✅ 2026-06-15 | — | `/api/agent/route.ts` — on Groq throw, reassign `choice` to Anthropic Haiku + fall through. +2 tests. |
| T1-5 | Muapi credit post-confirm deduction (deduct AFTER API success, not before) | 2h | ✅ 2026-06-15 | — | ALREADY CORRECT — `spendCredits` fires only after confirmed `resultUrl` (route.ts:398/414). Audit misread; no change needed. |
| T1-6 | pbEscape() audit (grep all filter strings for unescaped user-controlled input) | 2h | ✅ 2026-06-15 | — | Fixed 6 injection vectors: `clients` (×2), `departments/choose`, `stripe/portal`, `stripe/checkout-topup`, `book/[slug]` + `availability` (public path!). +4 pbEscape contract tests. |
| T1-6b | pbEscape() codebase-wide standardization (defense-in-depth follow-up) | 1h | ✅ 2026-06-15 | T1-6 | A better grep caught sites the `filter=`-only grep missed. Escaped ALL remaining interpolations: `stripe/webhook` (9), `stripe/checkout` + `checkout-addon` + `checkout-ceo-addon` (userId from body — **were also injectable**), `credits.ts`, `vault/outcomes.ts`, `book` host.user (×2), and converted 4 manual `.replace(/"/g,…)` sites (`account/delete`, `account/export-data`, `vault/patterns/list`, `setup/users`) to single-quote + pbEscape. Whole codebase now uses one convention. Updated 2 test mocks. |
| T1-7 | Vault dead-letter queue (add retry_count + last_error to vault_queue; skip after 3 fails) | 6h | ✅ 2026-06-15 | — | ALREADY IMPLEMENTED — `vault_ingest_queue` has attempts + last_error + exp-backoff + terminal `dead` after MAX_ATTEMPTS=5 (`_lib/vault/queue.ts`). Worker routes all failures through `fail()`. Audit misread; no change needed. |
| T1-8 | Setup routes auth protection (require ADMIN_SECRET header on all `/api/setup/*`) | 3h | ✅ 2026-06-15 | — | `middleware.ts` gates `/api/setup/:path*` via `_lib/setup-auth.ts` `checkSetupAuth()`. **Fail-closed**: 503 if `ADMIN_SECRET` unset, 401 if wrong. Verified live (503). +6 tests. |

**Tier 1 total: ~22.6h**

## SECTION 3 — TIER 2: FEATURE COMPLETION
> Closes the obvious product gaps. ~109h total.

Graceful "not enabled yet" message until PB config. +2 tests, browser-verified. |
| FC-5a | Autopilot: data reader worker (reads Stripe MRR + connected integration data → brief struct) | 10h | ⬜ | MS-A | `/api/worker/autopilot/route.ts` (new) |
| FC-5b | Autopilot: W71 task queue builder (brief struct → enqueue W71 tasks per dept) | 10h | ⬜ | FC-5a, T1-1 | `lib/workflow.ts`, `/api/workflow/enqueue/route.ts` |
| FC-5c | Autopilot: approval notification + UI (push notification with approve/skip per task) | 8h | ⬜ | FC-5b | `/api/push/send/route.ts`, new `/dashboard/autopilot` review page |
| FC-6a | Team workspaces: data model (add `workspace_id` to users + subscriptions + documents + conversations) | 10h | ⬜ | — | `/api/setup/` routes, row-rules registry |
| FC-6b | Team workspaces: invite flow (invite by email, accept link, join workspace) | 16h | ⬜ | FC-6a | `/api/workspace/invite/route.ts` (new), `/join/[token]` page |
| FC-6c | Team workspaces: shared vault scope (agency team shares client documents + conversation threads) | 10h | ⬜ | FC-6a | `/api/agent/route.ts`, `/api/vault/**` |

**Tier 2 total: ~109h**

| MS-C1 | Marketplace Phase 1: internal pack builder tool (Cybrid Agency creates packs via UI) | 20h | ⬜ | — | `packages/agents/` pack schema, new `/dashboard/admin/packs` page |

| MX-4 | Document search UI: "search my vault" page using Qdrant semantic search already built | 8h | ✅ 2026-06-15 | NEW `POST /api/vault/search` (whoAmI-secured — userId from token, not body) + `/dashboard/search` page + Library entry point. Closes the pricing-page "Smart Search" promise. +5 tests, browser-verified render. |

**Missing total: ~39h**

---

## SECTION 6 — DEFERRED (deliberately not in scope)

| Item | Reason |
|---|---|

| MS-E: Franchise OS pitch | Sales motion before product build; identify pilot franchise first |
| Elevenlabs voice fingerprinting | Deferred to after MS-B2 voice output ships |
| Plausible Analytics read integration | Low priority; internal product analytics after scale |
| Bundle 5 OCR/vision | Wait until a paying customer requests it |
| Bundle 7 scheduling/transcript | Wait for voice pipeline (MS-B) to complete first |
| super_admin_usage_log | Activate when user base justifies margin analysis |
